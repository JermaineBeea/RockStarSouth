- **Issue:** [Summarize the main code smell or problem]
- **Complexity:** [Estimate: Low/Medium/High or numeric]
- **Problems:** 
  - [List specific issues, e.g., duplicated code, hardcoded logic, poor maintainability, etc.]

```

## Refactoring Strategy

### **Step 1: [First Refactoring Step]**
- [Describe the first step, e.g., extract common logic, introduce helper methods, etc.]

### **Step 2: [Second Refactoring Step]**
- [Describe the next step, e.g., implement parameterization, data-driven testing, etc.]

## Refactored Code

```java
[Insert refactored code or pseudocode here, focusing on structure, not implementation details]
```

### **Alternative Approach: [Optional Alternative, e.g., Parameterized Tests]**
```java
[Insert alternative code structure or pseudocode here]
```
